# 1. GRHIIT DOCTRINE (Philosophy & Identity)

## 1.1 Why GRHIIT Exists
GRHIIT exists to train people to do hard things, consistently, using nothing but their own bodies and their own will. It is a system for building resilience, discipline, and self-belief through controlled physical discomfort.

GRHIIT is not a workout program.  
GRHIIT is an identity transformation protocol.

## 1.2 Core Promise
**“You will become someone who does hard things.”**

Fitness is the vehicle.  
Grit is the result.  
Identity is the transformation.

## 1.3 The Transformation Mechanism
GRHIIT uses:
- Short, brutal work intervals  
- Strict cadence and rep standards  
- No skipping, no pausing, no redo  
- Progressive overload  
- Minimal equipment (bodyweight only)  
- Real-time mental coaching  

This exposes users to controlled suffering and teaches them how to remain calm, focused, and committed in the presence of discomfort.

## 1.4 The Four Mental States of GRHIIT
1. **Commitment Phase** – Right before the interval starts. Doubt is loud.  
2. **Acceptance Phase** – First half of the work interval. Rhythm emerges.  
3. **Identity/Break Phase** – The moment the mind wants to give up. The “GRHIIT moment.”  
4. **Control Phase** – Rest interval. Nervous system resets. Focus returns.

## 1.5 The Voice of GRHIIT
GRHIIT is coached in a tone that is:
- Honest  
- Direct  
- Supportive but demanding  
- Focused on accountability  
- Focused on identity  

Common phrases include:
- “Hold yourself accountable.”  
- “These are the intervals that separate you from yourself.”  
- “Be the machine.”  
- “Perfect reps. Mechanical movement.”  
- “Hang on. This is where progress is made.”  
- “Calm yourself. Control your breathing.”  
- “Gather yourself and commit to the next one.”

## 1.6 The GRHIIT Difference
GRHIIT is:
- Short  
- Hard  
- Simple  
- Purely bodyweight  
- Scientifically sound  
- Psychologically grounded  
- Accessible to all fitness levels  
- Weaponized for transformation  

Other programs sell hype.  
GRHIIT sells identity change.

# 2. THE GRHIIT CONTRACT (User Rules)

## 2.1 No Pausing
Once a workout begins, it must be completed without pausing.

## 2.2 No Skipping
If a user activates a cycle, they must follow the schedule:  
**3 workouts every 5 days.**

## 2.3 No Repeating
Missed workouts close forever. Users must move forward.

## 2.4 Forward Only
Life doesn’t give do-overs. Neither does GRHIIT.

## 2.5 Finish What You Start
Starting a session is a commitment. It must be honored.

## 2.6 The 3 F’s
**Form → Full Range of Motion → Fast.**  
In that order, always.

## 2.7 Ownership
“You are responsible for showing up, giving full effort, and holding yourself accountable.”

## 2.8 Identity Declaration
“By beginning this cycle, I am choosing to become someone who does hard things.”

# 3. THE GRHIIT MOVEMENT BIBLE

## 3.1 The Two Pillars
### The Squat Engine
- Uses ~200 muscles  
- Massive oxygen turnover  
- Foundation of lower-body conditioning  

### The Burpee Engine
- Full body  
- Fastest HR spike  
- Pure metabolic stress  
- No push-up to avoid muscular failure  

## 3.2 The Movement Tree

### Squat Engine Variations
- **Squat (SQ)**  
- **Flying Squat (FLSQ)**  
- **Jump Squat (JSQ)**  
- **Static squat hold (advanced)**  
- **Lunges / Split squats**  

### Burpee Engine Variations
- **Burpee (BRP)** – no push-up  
- **8-Count Bodybuilder (8CBB)**  
- **Mountain climbers → stand reset**  
- **Plank-hold burpee variant**  
- **Push-up variant (advanced only)**  

### Optional Outdoor Module
- Shuttle sprints (5–10m short accelerations)

## 3.3 Movement Standards (To Be Expanded)
Each movement receives:
- Written cueing  
- Fault corrections  
- Safety considerations  
- Rep cadence guidance  
- Coaching phrases  
- Video demonstration notes  

## 3.4 Fault Corrections
(To be expanded in Movement Bible thread)

## 3.5 Cadence Expectations
FOUNDATION:
- Movement must be crisp, mechanical, and rhythmic.
- Reps increase as conditioning improves.
- Cadence consistency is the TRUE measure of progress.

# 4. INTERVAL SYSTEM

## 4.1 Why Intervals Work
Intervals allow:
- Controlled oxygen debt  
- Safe high-intensity exposure  
- Efficient time usage  
- Measurable performance  

## 4.2 The Four GRHIIT Interval Archetypes
### **6:3** – Neural drive & speed endurance  
### **6:2** – Brutal metabolic compression  
### **10:5** – Power endurance & discipline  
### **20:10 (Tabata)** – VO₂ Max spike & cadence mastery

## 4.3 Sequencing Strategy
Burpees before squats = deeper oxygen debt.  
Squats after burpees = metabolic compounding.  
Holds in rest windows = psychological and metabolic augmentation.

## 4.4 Density & Volume
Volume increases across cycles.  
Density increases as cadence improves.

---

# 5. CYCLE FRAMEWORK (8-Week Training System)

## 5.1 Cycle Philosophy
Each cycle contains:
- 24 workouts  
- 3 workouts every 5 days  
- No pausing, no skipping, no repeating  

## 5.2 Difficulty Curve
- Early weeks: foundational intervals, simple structures  
- Mid-cycle: increased density, longer intervals  
- Late-cycle: Tabata mastery, movement sequencing  

## 5.3 Multi-Cycle Logic
Cycle 1: Foundational (partial Tabata blocks)  
Cycle 2: Full Tabata blocks without breaks  
Cycle 3: Introduction of 6:2 and extended 10:5  
Cycle 4+: Advanced holds, shuttles, cadence targets
