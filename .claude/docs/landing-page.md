## HERO SECTION

**YOU’RE NOT TRAINING.  
YOU’RE JUST WORKING OUT.**

Most people don’t have a fitness problem.  
They have a **follow-through** problem.

GRHIIT is a bodyweight-only training system built to do one thing:  
turn you into the kind of person who does hard things on purpose.

Short, brutal intervals.  
No equipment.  
No hiding.

When you commit to this, you’re not just changing your body.  
You’re rewriting who you are.

## PROBLEM / COMMITMENT SECTION

**THAT’S NOT A FITNESS PROBLEM.  
THAT’S A COMMITMENT PROBLEM.**

You’ve seen the pattern:

- You start when you’re motivated.  
- You go hard for a week or two.  
- Then life gets busy… and the promise you made to yourself quietly disappears.

You tell yourself you’ll “start again Monday.”  
You wait for the perfect routine, the perfect gym, the perfect time.

It never really arrives.

GRHIIT is built to remove that negotiation.

You don’t need more motivation.  
You need a **structure** that forces you to keep the promises you make to yourself — even on the days you don’t feel like it.

The intensity doesn’t come from hype.  
**It comes from the rules of the system.**

## WHAT IS GRHIIT / SYSTEM EXPLAINER

**GRHIIT IS A DISCIPLINE PROTOCOL DISGUISED AS A WORKOUT.**

Here’s what it looks like in real life:

- **Bodyweight only.** Squats, burpee variations, bodybuilders, simple shuttles. Movements you can do anywhere.  
- **Short sessions.** Around 15 minutes — short enough to fit into a crowded day, long enough to test you.  
- **Timed intervals.** You work when the clock says work. You rest when the clock says rest. No pausing. No bargaining.  
- **Forward-only progression.** Once you complete a session, it’s done. No repeating. No “redo.” You move forward.

You’re not chasing calories burned.  
You’re building a **Squat Engine** and a **Burpee Engine** — and, even more importantly, a mind that refuses to fold when things get uncomfortable.

The app will guide you through each interval, cue your breathing, and coach you through the exact moments you normally quit.

You just have one job:  
**show up and follow through.**

## THE 8-WEEK CYCLE (GENERALIZED)

**THE 8-WEEK CYCLE**

Same simple movements.  
Smarter structure.  
Higher demand on your focus, lungs, and resolve.

Over eight weeks:

- Your rest windows tighten.  
- Your work blocks feel longer.  
- Your time “in the hurt” increases — slowly enough to be doable, ruthlessly enough to change you.

The sessions don’t get easier.  
**You get harder to break.**

You’ll feel it in your legs.  
You’ll hear it in your breathing.  
You’ll notice it most in the way you start to handle everything else in your life.

## TRANSFORMATION / IDENTITY SECTION

**WEEK 1:**  
You’re just trying to survive the timer.  
You’re learning the movements, fighting the urge to stop, realizing how loud your excuses really are.

**WEEKS 3–5:**  
You recover faster.  
You hear the cue, and instead of bargaining, you move.  
You start trusting yourself again.

**WEEK 8:**  
You’re sustaining intensity you couldn’t have imagined on Day 1.  
You don’t wait to feel motivated — you move because that’s who you are now.

That’s not “getting in shape.”  
**That’s building a new default identity.**

---

## SOCIAL PROOF / POSITIONING (PRE-LAUNCH)

**BUILT FROM THOUSANDS OF REAL INTERVALS.**

GRHIIT wasn’t created on a whiteboard.  
It was forged under a clock, under fatigue, under real oxygen debt.

Every structure, every interval pattern, every cue comes from years of testing on real bodies — including Kevin’s own.

This isn’t a library of random workouts.  
It’s a **deliberate progression** that respects your joints, punishes your excuses, and rewards one thing above all:

**honest effort.**

---

## WHO THIS IS FOR

**GRHIIT IS FOR YOU IF:**

- You’re tired of starting over every few months.  
- You don’t have an hour for the gym, but you *do* have 15 minutes you could stop wasting.  
- You want a routine that doesn’t depend on equipment, weather, or a commute.  
- You care less about shortcuts and more about becoming the person who shows up no matter what.

If you want easy, this isn’t it.  
If you’re ready to work hard for a short, focused window — this can change everything.

## COACHING LANGUAGE / APP EXPERIENCE

**YOU WON’T BE ALONE IN THE HURT.**

When you’re in the middle of a GRHIIT session, the app isn’t just counting time.

You’ll hear:

> “Hold yourself accountable.”  
> “These are the intervals that separate you from yourself.”  
> “Be the machine.”  
> “Hang on — this is where progress is made.”  
> “Calm your breathing. Regain focus. Commit to the next block.”

These aren’t generic voiceovers.  
They’re recorded *after* the sessions are actually performed, so the pacing and emotion match exactly where you are in the fight.

It feels like having a coach in your ear who knows how your mind tries to escape — and refuses to let you bail.
