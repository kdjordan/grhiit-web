HERO:
YOU'RE NOT TRAINING. YOU'RE JUST WORKING OUT.
Subheadline: Progressive bodyweight intervals. Mental discipline through sustained intensity.

PROBLEM-AGITATE:
You show up when you're motivated. When the gym is close. When conditions are right.
Then life happens.
The result: you're always starting over. Always negotiating with yourself. Always waiting for the right moment.
That's not a fitness problem. That's a commitment problem.

WHAT IS GRHIIT:
GRHIIT is a system for building mental discipline through physical intensity — a practice, not a workout.
220+ reps. 16 minutes. Zero equipment.
Structured intervals: 6-20 second work, 3-10 second rest. Short enough to maintain form. Long enough to stay in the hurt.
The intensity comes from the structure, not your motivation.

THE 8-WEEK CYCLE:
Week 1-2: 6 sec work / 3 sec rest
Week 3-4: 8 sec work / 3 sec rest
Week 5-6: 10 sec work / 2 sec rest
Week 7-8: 12 sec work / 2 sec rest
Same movements. Less rest. More time under tension.
The sessions don't get easier. They get longer. You get capable of more.

TRANSFORMATION:
Week 1: You survive 16 minutes.
Week 8: You sustain 30 minutes at intensity you couldn't have imagined 2 months ago.
That's not fitness. That's rewiring who you are.
