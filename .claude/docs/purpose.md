# GRHIIT

**GRHIIT (Grit High-Intensity Interval Training)** is a training system built on real HIIT protocols—not trends.  
It uses **time-based**, **bodyweight-only** intervals to push you into real oxygen debt, safely and progressively.  
No equipment. No fluff. **Intensity, discipline, consistency**—anywhere, anytime.

---

## What GRHIIT Is
- A structured HIIT method refined over decades of coaching.
- Built around short, brutal intervals (e.g., 20:10 / 6:3 / 60:20) with **progressive overload**.
- **Bodyweight-only** movements for safety, speed, and universal accessibility.
- Laser-focused on **mental toughness** and **repeatable effort**, not gimmicks.

## What GRHIIT Is Not
- It’s not an AI-assembled, influencer routine.
- It’s not equipment-dependent or space-dependent.
- It’s not random “sweat for the sake of sweat.” Every interval has intention.

---

## The Promise
Show up, do the work, and we’ll give you:
- **Clear timers and progressions**
- **Scalable intensity** for any fitness level
- **A system that builds grit** as much as it builds capacity

> **All it takes is all you’ve got.**

---

## How It Works (Program Overview)
- You start at **Workout 1** and move forward—no endless "choose your own" confusion.
- **24 total workouts** across **8 weeks** (3 per week) with precise progression.
- **Work-to-rest ratios** create controlled oxygen debt: start 2:1, build toward Tabata (20:10).
- **Bodyweight movements**: squats, jump squats, burpees (no push-up), eight-count bodybuilders, flying squats.
- **Rep counting accountability**: You count your reps, you vs you—no external validation needed.
- **Progressive difficulty**: Shorter intervals early → longer, more challenging intervals as you adapt.

---

## Why It Works
- **Scientific work-to-rest ratios** → create controlled oxygen debt for maximum adaptation.
- **Bodyweight-only** → removes friction; you can't miss, universal accessibility.
- **Rep counting accountability** → honest self-assessment builds mental toughness.
- **Progressive oxygen debt training** → builds capacity to push through when "completely gassed."
- **Mental resilience focus** → learning to maintain effort when your body wants to quit.
- **Individual challenge** → moving YOUR body through space, not comparing to others.

## Founder’s Note

I’m **Kevin Jordan (51)**—a lifelong athlete who’s coached thousands through real HIIT.  
GRHIIT is my **escape-velocity project**: a way to help people build **mental grit, personal discipline, and physical resilience** using the simplest tools possible—their body and a timer.

This isn’t a brand looking for a gimmick. It’s a **method**—the one I trust with my own life and energy.
